# Business Team Builder
In the Computer Coding Bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania, via Trilogy Educational Services, we have been tasked with the following:

### ORIGINAL README INSTRUCTIONS
-build a software engineering team generator command line application. 
-application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. 
-user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 
-must also pass all tests. 
-application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

## Dependencies
-Inquirer
-Jest

## Future Implementation(s)
-reformat manager questions, assuming that the manager is the user, so that s/he is prompted to enter certain information, following which s/he will be asked to enter one of two employee types
-present a question asking if s/he would like to add a new team member
-when the manager selects "no" in response to the previous question, all information is used to create the HTML page
-create open containers that allow future users to create their own types of employees without limiting the number of said types

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For any larger changes, open an issue to discuss what you think should be changed. Please keep all criticism constructive. 

All advice/suggestions are appreciated in advance!

## Acknowledgement
As usual, enormous gratitude to Meguel Chavez, my tutor and mentor in coding; Erik Donovan and Giannis Sporidis-Foster, my project mates who are both already fantastic coders; and Tom Woods, one of the Teaching Assitants in the program, who spoke with me in the final minutes outside of office hours and gave wonderful insight into some scoping issues that I couldn't decipher. 

## Project Status
I will continue to work on the functionality of this project, especially regarding how my questions are organized, looping through them properly, and sending all input to the HTML page after USER has chosen not to add further team members in a given session.
